  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 18, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Applies to:</strong> Everyone who uses, hosts, modifies, or even peeks at the code of this bot</p>

  <h2>1. License and Usage</h2>
  <p>This bot is open-source and proudly served under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.</p>
  <p>You’re allowed to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Host your own version</li>
    <li>Modify it for personal or public use</li>
    <li>Laugh at the code quality (please not too hard)</li>
    <li>Share it with your grandma, if she’s into bots</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But please don’t:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sell this bot as-is and pretend you made it from scratch</li>
    <li>Use it for shady, sketchy, or scummy purposes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Data and Privacy</h2>
  <p>This bot stores a tiny bit of data to function:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>User IDs, EXP, and Tokens</li>
  </ul>
  <p>That’s it. No emails, no credit card numbers, no browser history, no grandma’s cookie recipes.</p>
  <p>Data is stored in simple .json files, and only exists locally on your host machine.</p>
  <p>If you’re self-hosting, you are fully responsible for keeping that data safe.</p>
  <p>If you’re not hosting, don’t worry—your data isn’t going anywhere. Like, literally. It just sits there.</p>

  <h2>3. Responsibility of Use</h2>
  <p>By using this bot, you acknowledge:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You’re responsible for any changes you make. If you break it, you buy it (just kidding—but seriously, don’t ask why it’s broken if you rewrote half the code).</li>
    <li>This bot is for fun, productivity, and light chaos—not cyber warfare.</li>
    <li>Don’t weaponize the XP system. You know what you did.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Support and Liability</h2>
  <p>This is a community-driven, open-source project. That means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No guarantee of uptime, updates, or bug-fixes (but I try, okay?)</li>
    <li>If the bot eats your tokens or EXP? Sorry, no refunds.</li>
    <li>If the bot gains sentience and challenges you to a duel? You're on your own.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Humor Clause</h2>
  <p>By continuing to use this bot, you agree that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A bit of humor is allowed in serious documents like this one</li>
    <li>The developer is probably running on bread, milk, and vibes</li>
    <li>This ToS may self-destruct if taken too seriously</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions, bugs, or to send fan mail (or hate mail, I guess?), you can reach out at:</p>
  <p><strong>@MeIsNegative on Discord and Tumblr</strong></p>
  <p>Or shout into the void. That works too.</p>

  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>Use it. Don't abuse it. Be chill. Be cool. Don’t sell it as your own. Now go touch grass, then come back and make something cool with the bot.</p>
